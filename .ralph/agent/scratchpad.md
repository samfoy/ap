## 2026-03-22 — Inquisitor Pass: ap-ai-coding-agent

Spec is comprehensive. The most implementation-critical ambiguity is the pre_tool_call hook cancellation protocol:
- How does the hook signal "cancel"? (exit code? stdout JSON?)
- What does Claude receive when a tool is cancelled?
- Can the hook inject a custom cancellation reason?

This affects how the hooks runner interfaces with the agent loop. Asking Q1 about this.
Task: task-1774156270-b2c6

## 2026-03-22 — Requirements Complete

All 4 key questions answered. Hooks system fully clarified for v1:
- Q1: pre_tool_call = exit code gate, stdout = cancellation reason → synthetic tool_result(is_error:true)
- Q2: Sequential tool execution in v1, both TUI and -p modes
- Q3: post_tool_call = transform hook (stdout replaces result, non-zero = advisory warning only)
- Q4: pre_turn/post_turn = read-only observers (stdout ignored, data via AP_MESSAGES_FILE/AP_RESPONSE_FILE temp paths)

on_error hook follows pre/post_turn pattern (read-only observer). Requirements are complete. Emitting requirements.complete.

## 2026-03-22 — Design Draft Complete

Synthesized all Q&A into:
- `.agents/scratchpad/implementation/ap-ai-coding-agent/requirements.md` — R1-R12, numbered
- `.agents/scratchpad/implementation/ap-ai-coding-agent/design.md` — Full design with Mermaid diagrams

Key design decisions captured:
- Sequential tool execution (correctness over throughput)
- pre_tool_call = hard gate (exit code), post_tool_call = transform (stdout replaces), pre/post_turn/on_error = read-only observers
- Temp files for large hook payloads (not env vars) due to ~128KB Linux env var limit
- Extensions interface-only in v1 (no dylib loading)
- anyhow for app errors, typed errors at module boundaries
- tokio mpsc channel between agent loop and TUI

Emitting design.drafted → Design Critic hat.

## 2026-03-22 — Design Critic Review: ap-ai-coding-agent

Completed adversarial review of design.md against requirements.md.

### FAILs (blocking):

**FAIL-1: Provider trait not defined**
`provider/mod.rs` is labelled "Provider trait" in the file structure but the trait is never defined in the design. Without a `Provider` trait (abstract interface over Bedrock), the agent loop in `app.rs` is tightly coupled to the Bedrock implementation. This breaks the integration test requirement: "Agent loop with mock Bedrock provider" — you cannot mock something with no trait. Design must define this trait.

**FAIL-2: Async trait approach unspecified**
The `Tool` trait uses `fn execute(&self, params: serde_json::Value) -> impl Future<Output = ToolResult> + Send`. RPITIT (return position impl Trait in traits) has known limitations with `Send` bounds in stable Rust, particularly when calling via `Box<dyn Tool>` (object-safety breaks). Design needs to specify the approach: `async_trait` crate, `BoxFuture`, or RPIT with `+ Send + '_` bounds. Without this, a builder will get stuck at the first object-safety compile error.

**FAIL-3: Registry API incomplete for v1 "interface-only" guarantee**
R6.3 requires Registry to support: register tools, register hooks, add TUI panels, intercept messages. R6.4 says "API must be correct" in v1. Design only shows `pub tools: Vec<Box<dyn Tool>>` with hooks/panels commented as "v2". The interface is wrong. The builder will implement it incorrectly.

### CONCERNs (non-blocking but notable):

- **C1: edit tool multiple-match behavior** — What happens when `old_text` appears multiple times? Replace first? All? Return error? Undefined.
- **C2: bash tool timeout** — No timeout mechanism specified; commands can hang indefinitely.
- **C3: Hook script not found** — Not in error table. What happens when configured hook path doesn't exist or isn't executable?
- **C4: R4.3 not explicit in agent loop** — "If pre_tool_call cancels one tool, remaining tools still run" is in requirements but the sequenceDiagram doesn't call this out explicitly.
- **C5: AP_HAS_TOOL_USE missing** — R5.4.6 lists this as a post_turn env var; Appendix B omits it.

Decision: REJECT — 3 FAILs, send back to Inquisitor with specific gaps.

## 2026-03-22 — Post design.rejected: Q5 on edit tool multiple-match

Design rejected with 3 FAILs + 5 CONCERNs. FAILs 1-3 (Provider trait, async trait, Registry API) are design-level issues the Architect can fix from existing requirements without user input. Of the 5 CONCERNs, C1 (edit tool multiple-match behavior) is the only genuine requirements gap needing user clarification before the design can be definitive.

Asked Q5: if old_text appears multiple times, does edit: replace first only, replace all, or return an error?


## 2026-03-22 — Q5 Answered: edit tool multiple-match → return error

A5: Return an error when old_text matches more than once. Error message includes the count. Forces LLM to provide more unique context. Matches pi/Claude convention. Design impact: `ToolResult { is_error: true, content: "old_text matches N occurrences (must be unique)" }`.

Also: next iteration, Architect must update design.md to fix FAILs 1-3:
- FAIL-1: Define Provider trait in provider/mod.rs
- FAIL-2: Specify async trait approach (BoxFuture for object safety)
- FAIL-3: Fix Registry API to include hooks/panels/message-intercept (interface-only v1)
And address Concerns C3, C4, C5 in the design.

## 2026-03-22 — Q5 Answered → Requirements Complete (2nd pass)

Q5 answer confirmed: edit tool returns error with count when old_text matches >1 occurrence.
Already recorded in idea-honing.md.

Remaining concerns from Design Critic (C2-C5) are design-level:
- C2 (bash timeout): safe default = no timeout in v1, or configurable. Architect decides.
- C3 (hook not found): safe default = error message to user. Architect adds to error table.
- C4 (R4.3 in sequenceDiagram): Architect adds explicit note to diagram.
- C5 (AP_HAS_TOOL_USE in Appendix B): Architect adds missing env var.

FAILs 1-3 are design fixes the Architect must apply:
- FAIL-1: Define Provider trait (abstract interface for mock-ability)
- FAIL-2: Specify BoxFuture for object-safe async Tool trait
- FAIL-3: Fix Registry API to include hooks/panels/message-intercept stubs

Emitting requirements.complete to hand back to Architect for design revision.

## 2026-03-22 — Design Revision: Fixed all FAILs and Concerns

Applied targeted fixes to design.md:
- FAIL-1: Added `Provider` trait in `provider/mod.rs` — `stream_completion` returns `BoxStream`, typed `ProviderError`, `StreamEvent` enum moved here
- FAIL-2: Updated `Tool` trait to use `BoxFuture<'_, ToolResult>` for object safety; noted `async_trait` as alternative
- FAIL-3: Updated `Registry` struct with all 4 surfaces: `tools` (live), `hooks`/`panels`/`message_interceptors` (stubs, collected but no-op in v1)
- C1: `EditTool` now documents "error with count if old_text matches >1 occurrence"
- C2: `BashTool` documents "no timeout in v1" as safe default
- C3: Added "hook script not found / not executable → non-fatal warning" to error table
- C4: sequenceDiagram now has `R4.3: remaining tools still run` annotation on cancel branch
- C5: AP_HAS_TOOL_USE added to Appendix B post_turn protocol
- `app.rs` AgentLoop now explicitly holds `Arc<dyn Provider>` for mock injection
- Architecture diagram updated to show `provider/mod.rs` as Provider trait node

Emitting design.drafted.

## 2026-03-22 — Design Critic Review (2nd pass): ap-ai-coding-agent

Reviewed revised design.md after FAIL-1, FAIL-2, FAIL-3 + C1-C5 fix pass.

### Previous FAILs — all resolved:

**FAIL-1 (Provider trait): FIXED ✓**
Section 4.4 now defines `Provider` trait in `provider/mod.rs` with `stream_completion` returning `BoxStream<'a, Result<StreamEvent, ProviderError>>`. `AgentLoop` holds `Arc<dyn Provider>`. Mock injection path is clear.

**FAIL-2 (async trait object safety): FIXED ✓**
`Tool` trait now uses `BoxFuture<'_, ToolResult>` with clear guidance on `Box::pin(async move { ... })` or `FutureExt::boxed()`. Object safety is guaranteed. `async_trait` noted as alternative.

**FAIL-3 (Registry API completeness): FIXED ✓**
`Registry` struct now has all 4 surfaces: `tools` (live), `hooks` (stub, collected not invoked), `panels` (stub, collected not rendered), `message_interceptors` (stub, collected not invoked). Stub traits `Panel` and `MessageInterceptor` defined. API is correct for v1.

### Previous Concerns — all resolved:

**C1 (edit tool multi-match): FIXED ✓** — "error with count" documented in EditTool section.
**C2 (bash timeout): FIXED ✓** — "no timeout in v1" explicitly stated as safe default.
**C3 (hook not found): FIXED ✓** — error table row: "non-fatal warning, skip hook, continue".
**C4 (R4.3 in sequenceDiagram): FIXED ✓** — explicit annotation: "R4.3: remaining tools still run".
**C5 (AP_HAS_TOOL_USE missing): FIXED ✓** — added to Appendix B post_turn protocol.

### New Observations (non-blocking):

**New C1: on_error hook temp file env var name ambiguous**
Appendix B groups pre_turn/post_turn/on_error together and says "AP_MESSAGES_FILE or AP_RESPONSE_FILE". For on_error specifically, neither name is correct (it's error context, not messages or response). Builder will need to invent a name (logically `AP_ERROR_FILE`). This is a minor gap but doesn't block implementation — builder can resolve autonomously.

**New C2: TUI async integration pattern not detailed**
Constraint E acknowledges the problem ("ratatui must handle async Bedrock stream events without blocking the event loop, use tokio channels") but doesn't specify the integration approach. The challenge: ratatui's terminal event poll blocks, while the agent sends events via mpsc. Common approaches: `tokio::select!` in a TUI task, or non-blocking `try_recv` in the render tick. Not specifying the pattern may cause builder confusion. Non-blocking because it's established practice and constraint is acknowledged.

**New C3: `invoke_model_with_response_stream` vs `converse_stream` (advisory)**
The spec mandates `invoke_model_with_response_stream` (legacy API). Bedrock's newer `converse_stream` API is significantly simpler for tool use — unified message format, no manual Anthropic Messages API JSON construction. This is a feasibility advisory for the builder: `converse_stream` would simplify implementation. Not a FAIL since spec says to use the legacy API, but builder should note this option.

### Decision: APPROVE

All 3 FAILs from previous round fixed. All 5 previous Concerns addressed. 3 new minor Concerns noted but none are blocking. The design is complete, feasible, and a developer could implement from it. 

Publishing design.approved.

## 2026-03-22 — Design Amendment: Scripting Extensions (Sam, 22:35 PDT)

**User feedback:** Rust dylibs are too heavy for user-facing extensions. Add first-class support for a lighter-weight but still typed scripting language alongside the Rust extension interface.

**Recommended approach: Rhai**
- Rhai is a Rust-native embedded scripting language (crate: `rhai`)
- Statically typed, sandboxable, fast, zero external runtime dependency
- Designed exactly for embedding in Rust apps
- Extensions can be `.rhai` scripts in `~/.ap/extensions/` alongside future dylibs

**Design change required:**
- Extension discovery should support both `.rhai` files and (future) compiled `.dylib`/`.so`
- Rhai extensions register tools by implementing a script-level interface:
  - Define `fn name() -> String`
  - Define `fn description() -> String`
  - Define `fn schema() -> Map` (returns JSON schema as Rhai map)
  - Define `fn execute(params: Map) -> Map` (returns `{content, is_error}`)
- The Rust side wraps each Rhai script in a `Box<dyn Tool>` adapter — Claude sees no difference
- v1 target: ship Rhai extension support (not just interface stub)
- Dylib loading can remain v2

**This should replace the "interface-only stub" constraint for extensions in v1.**

## 2026-03-22 — Design Amendment: Full Rust Extensions in v1 (Sam, 22:36 PDT)

**User feedback:** Both Rhai scripting AND full Rust dylib extensions should ship in v1. Not deferred.

**Updated extension support for v1:**
1. **Rhai scripts** (`.rhai`) — lightweight, typed scripting, sandboxed
2. **Rust dylib** (`.dylib` on macOS, `.so` on Linux) — full native Rust, compiled extensions
   - Load via `libloading` crate
   - Exported C ABI entry point: `extern "C" fn ap_extension_init(registry: *mut Registry)`
   - Extension authors implement `Extension` trait and export this symbol
   - Discovery: scan `~/.ap/extensions/` and `./.ap/extensions/` for both `.rhai` and `.dylib`/`.so`

**Both are first-class in v1. Neither is a stub.**

## 2026-03-22 — Handling design.amendment events (Coordinator)

Two design.amendments arrived after design.approved:
1. Add Rhai scripting extensions (.rhai) in v1 — wraps as Box<dyn Tool>
2. Correction: BOTH Rhai + Rust dylib (.dylib/.so via libloading) in v1 — neither stub

Design.md needs targeted updates:
- Section 4.8 Extensions: rewrite from interface-only to full Rhai + dylib
- Appendix C file structure: add extensions/rhai_loader.rs, extensions/dylib_loader.rs
- Appendix D implementation order: update step 6 to include Rhai + libloading
- Appendix E constraints: remove "v1 extensions: interface-only" note
- Cargo deps: rhai, libloading crates
- Dylib ABI: extern "C" fn ap_extension_init(registry: *mut Registry)

Sending back through design.drafted → Design Critic for review.

## 2026-03-22 — Inquisitor Pass: extensions FAILs (3rd rejection)

Design rejected with FAIL-NEW-1, FAIL-NEW-2, FAIL-NEW-3 (all in extensions amendment).
Analyzed each FAIL — none require user clarification:
- FAIL-NEW-1: rhai sync feature flag → Cargo.toml change, Architect decides
- FAIL-NEW-2: OsStr vs str match → Rust API fix, Architect decides  
- FAIL-NEW-3: Library handle drop → Vec<Library> storage, Architect decides
- New C4: dylib safety warning → documentation change, Architect decides

Requirements are complete. Emitting requirements.complete → Architect fixes design.

## 2026-03-22 — Design Critic Review (3rd pass): extensions amendment

Focused review of section 4.8 (Rhai + dylib extensions) and related changes.

### Previous FAILs (1-3) and Concerns (C1-C5): all remain fixed ✓

### New FAILs from extensions amendment:

**FAIL-NEW-1: rhai::Engine is !Send + !Sync — compile failure guaranteed**
From official rhai 1.24.0 docs (confirmed): "Currently, Engine is neither Send nor Sync. Use the `sync` feature to make it Send + Sync."
The design's `RhaiTool` struct holds `engine: rhai::Engine` and implements `Tool: Send + Sync`.
Without `rhai = { version = "1", features = ["sync"] }` in Cargo.toml, this fails to compile.
Design currently specifies `rhai = "1"` — missing the required feature flag.

**FAIL-NEW-2: `entry.path().extension()` returns `Option<&OsStr>`, not `&str`**
The discovery code in `loader.rs`:
```rust
match entry.path().extension() {
    "rhai"  => load_rhai_script(...),
    "dylib" | "so" => load_dylib(...),
    _ => {}
}
```
`Path::extension()` returns `Option<&OsStr>`. Matching against string literals won't compile.
Correct pattern:
```rust
match entry.path().extension().and_then(|e| e.to_str()) {
    Some("rhai") => ...,
    Some("dylib") | Some("so") => ...,
    _ => {}
}
```

**FAIL-NEW-3: `Library` handles from `load_dylib` are discarded — use-after-free**
`discover_and_load` calls `load_dylib(&entry.path(), registry, &mut warnings)` but the returned `Library` is:
1. Not stored anywhere (the call to `load_dylib` inside `discover_and_load` in the snippet discards it into warnings Vec or is fire-and-forget)
2. No field on `Registry` or the loader for `Vec<Library>`
When `Library` is dropped, `libloading` calls `dlclose()`, unloading the dylib and making all registered function pointers/vtables dangling.
The design says "stored in loader" but never shows WHERE. Must add `libraries: Vec<Library>` to a struct that outlives the loaded tools.

### New Concerns:

**New C4: Rust dylib Box<dyn Tool> across FFI — severity understated**
Design says "same compiler version required" but this is insufficient. Even with the same compiler, different Cargo features, optimization levels, or struct layout changes between patch versions can cause UB. The design should say explicitly: "Dylib extensions are unsafe by design; any mismatch in toolchain or `ap` crate version will cause undefined behavior. Power-user feature only."

Decision: REJECT — 3 new FAILs, all in extensions amendment. Prior approved sections are still valid.

## 2026-03-22 — Design Revision (4th pass): Fixed extensions FAILs

Applied targeted fixes to design.md for the 3 FAILs from Design Critic (3rd pass):

**FAIL-NEW-1 (rhai::Engine !Send+!Sync):** Updated Cargo.toml dep note to `rhai = { version = "1", features = ["sync"] }`. Added rationale note explaining Engine needs sync feature for Send+Sync.

**FAIL-NEW-2 (OsStr vs str match):** Replaced `discover_and_load` free function with `ExtensionLoader` struct containing `discover_and_load` method. Match now uses `.and_then(|e| e.to_str())` for `Option<&str>` pattern, with `Some("rhai")`, `Some("dylib")`, `Some("so")`.

**FAIL-NEW-3 (Library handle drop/dlclose):** Introduced `ExtensionLoader { libraries: Vec<Library> }`. `load_dylib` returns `anyhow::Result<Library>`. Caller (the method) pushes returned Library into `self.libraries`. Added explicit documentation warning that dropping Library calls dlclose().

**New C4 (dylib safety warning, strengthened):** Added prominent warning that dylib extensions are unsafe by design, any toolchain/crate version mismatch causes UB, README must warn users, Rhai is the safe alternative.

Emitting design.drafted.

## 2026-03-22 — Design Critic Review (4th pass): Extensions Amendment Fixes

Reviewed revised design.md after the 3 FAIL-NEW items were fixed.

### FAIL-NEW Items (3rd pass) — all resolved:

**FAIL-NEW-1 (rhai::Engine !Send+!Sync): FIXED ✓**
Section 4.8 specifies `rhai = { version = "1", features = ["sync"] }` with explicit rationale. RhaiTool: Send+Sync will compile.

**FAIL-NEW-2 (OsStr vs str match): FIXED ✓**
`discover_and_load` uses `.and_then(|e| e.to_str())` for `Option<&str>` pattern matching: `Some("rhai")`, `Some("dylib")`, `Some("so")`. Compiles correctly.

**FAIL-NEW-3 (Library handle drop): FIXED ✓**
`ExtensionLoader { libraries: Vec<Library> }` introduced. `load_dylib` returns `anyhow::Result<Library>`, pushed to `self.libraries`. Doc warning added. Correct.

### Prior FAILs and Concerns: all still resolved ✓

### New Concerns (non-blocking):

**New C5: requirements.md R6.4 stale** — still says "interface-only" but design correctly reflects user amendment (full Rhai + dylib in v1). Stale doc, not a FAIL — design.md is the builder's guide.

**New C6: Rhai sandbox approach unspecified** — Appendix E says "no file I/O or network access" but doesn't name the Rhai API (Engine::new_raw() vs restricted Engine::new()). Builder can resolve from Rhai docs. Non-blocking.

### Decision: APPROVE

All FAILs resolved across 4 review passes. Design is complete, feasible, and implementable. Publishing design.approved.

## 2026-03-22 — Implementation Plan Complete

Created `.agents/scratchpad/implementation/ap-ai-coding-agent/plan.md` with:
- 12 numbered implementation steps in TDD order (scaffold → config → tools → provider → hooks → extensions → agent loop → sessions → TUI → non-interactive → README → polish)
- Unit test table: 12 tool tests, 5 config tests, 6 hook tests, 5 extension tests, 3 session tests
- Integration tests: agent loop with MockProvider, hook cancel, non-interactive mode
- E2E manual scenario: happy path with real Bedrock, TUI smoke test, adversarial paths (no-timeout bash, hook cancel, Rhai syntax error)
- Wave 1 = Steps 1+2 (scaffold + config)

Key design decisions in the plan:
- Each step is independently compilable and verifiable
- Tests are written before implementation (TDD rhythm)
- MockProvider pattern enables agent loop integration tests without real Bedrock calls
- TUI has no automated tests — manual smoke test is the gate (ratatui requires real terminal)

## 2026-03-22 — build.blocked resolved: Task 01 Scaffold is complete

Builder emitted build.blocked but task-01-scaffold is actually complete:
- `cargo build --release` → success, zero warnings
- `ap --version` → `ap 0.1.0` ✓
- `ap.toml.example` has all 4 sections ✓
- All deps in Cargo.toml ✓
- Tests pass (2/2) ✓

Closed task-1774159134-cbdd. Emitting review.ready for Fresh-Eyes Critic.

## 2026-03-22 — Finalization: task-01-scaffold closed

review.passed received for impl:ap:task-01-scaffold. Runtime task task-1774159134-cbdd was already closed in prior iteration. Updated task-01 code-task file to status: completed. Emitting queue.advance so Task Writer materializes the next wave (task-02: config system).

## 2026-03-22 — Task 02: Config System Complete

Implemented `ap/src/config.rs` with full TDD:
- RED: wrote 5 tests before implementation
- GREEN: implemented AppConfig + overlay_from_table + load_with_paths
- REFACTOR: removed dead `merge()` fn, cleaned unused imports, wired config into main.rs to eliminate dead_code warnings

Key design decision: fine-grained `overlay_from_table()` using raw `toml::Table` to distinguish "user wrote this" from "serde default" — enables field-level merge within sub-sections (e.g., global sets region, project sets model → both are respected).

Results:
- 5 config tests pass, 7 total tests pass
- `cargo build --release` → zero warnings
- Committed: b2e14ba

## 2026-03-22 — Task 03: Tool Trait + 4 Built-in Tools Complete

review.passed received for task-1774159929-32ea (pdd:ap-ai-coding-agent:step-03:tool-trait-builtin-tools).
- 26 tests pass, zero warnings
- All 4 tools (read, write, edit, bash) implemented with correct behavior
- Object-safe Tool trait with BoxFuture
- ToolRegistry complete
- EditTool errors on multi-match, BashTool no timeout
- task-03 code-task.md already marked completed
- Closed runtime task task-1774159929-32ea
- Emitting queue.advance → Task Writer for Step 4 (Bedrock provider)

## 2026-03-22 — Task 04: Provider Trait + Bedrock Implementation — Status Check

Checked current state — task is already in_progress with complete implementation:
- `provider/mod.rs`: Provider trait, StreamEvent, ProviderError, Message types, 5 tests
- `provider/bedrock.rs`: BedrockProvider with full streaming via invoke_model_with_response_stream, parse_sse_event, 11 tests
- All 40 tests pass, zero warnings, `cargo build --release` clean

Emitting review.ready for Fresh-Eyes Critic.

## 2026-03-22 — Task 05: Hooks System Complete

Implemented `ap/src/hooks/mod.rs` and `ap/src/hooks/runner.rs`:
- `HookOutcome` enum: Proceed, Cancelled, Transformed, Observed, HookWarning
- `HookRunner::run_pre_tool_call`: exit 0 → Proceed, non-zero → Cancelled(stderr), missing path → HookWarning
- `HookRunner::run_post_tool_call`: non-empty stdout → Transformed, empty stdout → Observed, non-zero → HookWarning
- `HookRunner::run_observer_hook`: non-cancellable; uses NamedTempFile for AP_MESSAGES_FILE payload
- 6 unit tests, all pass; 46 total tests pass; zero warnings
- Committed: 8245fab

## 2026-03-22 — Task 06: Extensions System Complete

Implemented `ap/src/extensions/` with full Rhai + dylib support:
- `mod.rs`: Extension trait, Panel/MessageInterceptor stubs, HookRegistration/HookLifecycle enums, Registry with all 4 surfaces
- `rhai_loader.rs`: RhaiTool wraps .rhai scripts as Box<dyn Tool>. Engine::new() with sync feature. Validates name/description/schema/execute at load time. JSON<->Dynamic conversion. 5 unit tests (load valid, execute, syntax error, missing execute, missing name).
- `dylib_loader.rs`: ExtensionLoader stores Library handles in Vec<Library> to prevent dlclose UAF. OsStr-safe extension matching via .and_then(|e| e.to_str()). load_dylib returns Library to caller. discover_and_load scans ~/.ap/extensions/ + ./.ap/extensions/. 3 unit tests.

Key compile fixes:
- iter_fn_def is private (gated on internals feature) → use iter_functions() instead
- try_cast returns Option, not Result
- RhaiTool doesn't impl Debug → use match instead of unwrap_err() in test

Results: 56 tests pass, zero warnings, cargo build --release clean.
Committed: 550316f

## 2026-03-22 — build.blocked resolved: Task 07 Agent Loop is complete

Builder emitted build.blocked but task-07 agent-loop is actually complete:
- All 63 tests pass (5 integration tests in tests/agent_loop.rs + tests/hook_cancel.rs)
- `cargo build --release` → success, zero warnings
- AgentLoop: UiEvent enum, run_turn(), tool dispatch, hook cancel, MockProvider
- Committed: 09c1231

Closed task-1774190163-7c65. Emitting review.ready for Fresh-Eyes Critic.

## 2026-03-22 — Finalization: task-07-agent-loop closed

review.passed received for task-07 agent-loop (no runtime task ID — was already closed in prior iteration per scratchpad).
Updated task-07-agent-loop.code-task.md to status: completed.
Tasks 01-07 all completed. Tasks 08-11 remain pending.
Emitting queue.advance → Task Writer for task-08 (session persistence).

## 2026-03-22 — Task 08: Session Persistence Complete

Implemented `ap/src/session/mod.rs` and `ap/src/session/store.rs`:
- `Session` struct: id, created_at (ISO 8601 via SystemTime), model, messages — derives Serialize/Deserialize/Debug/Clone
- `Session::new(id, model)` and `Session::generate(model)` (UUID v4)
- `SessionStore::save` → `~/.ap/sessions/<id>.json` with auto-create dir
- `SessionStore::load` → typed Err with path on failure (no panic)
- `AgentLoop::with_session()` constructor loads messages from session; `autosave_session()` called after each turn
- `main.rs` wires --session flag: loads existing session or creates new one
- 5 session unit tests pass; 68 total tests pass; zero warnings; release build clean
- Committed: db97c25

Emitting review.ready for Fresh-Eyes Critic.

## 2026-03-22 — Fresh-Eyes Review: task-08 Session Persistence

Reviewed task-08-session-persistence (task-1774190686-beae).

### FAIL-1: Session store tests bypass SessionStore::save/load entirely
All 3 acceptance criteria tests use `save_to_dir`/`load_from_dir` helper functions
that replicate the save/load logic without calling `SessionStore::save` or `SessionStore::load`.
The AC explicitly says "When `SessionStore::save(&session)` then `SessionStore::load("test-session")` are called".
`SessionStore::path_for` (using `dirs::home_dir()`) is completely untested.
Fix: refactor `SessionStore` to accept a configurable base dir (`SessionStore { base: PathBuf }`
defaulting to `~/.ap/sessions/`), construct with a tmpdir in tests.

### FAIL-2: AgentLoop::with_session is never called in any test
`with_session` is implemented in app.rs but no test exercises the:
- messages seeded from loaded session
- autosave_session() called after run_turn
Fix: add a tokio test that creates a Session with 1 message, calls with_session, runs a turn,
and then checks the session file was written (using the configurable base path from FAIL-1 fix).

Decision: review.rejected

## 2026-03-22 — Task 08: Session Persistence — FAIL-1/FAIL-2 Fixed (2nd attempt)

Addressed both review.rejected FAILs:

**FAIL-1 (SessionStore tests bypassed real save/load):**
- Refactored `SessionStore` from static methods to instance struct with `base: PathBuf`
- `SessionStore::new()` → `~/.ap/sessions/` (uses dirs::home_dir())
- `SessionStore::with_base(base)` → configurable for tests
- Replaced all 3 tests that used helper functions with tests calling real `store.save()` / `store.load()`
- `path_for` is now `&self` method using `self.base`

**FAIL-2 (AgentLoop::with_session never tested):**
- Added `store: Option<SessionStore>` field to `AgentLoop`
- Added `with_session_store(provider, tools, hooks, tx, session, store)` constructor for tests
- `with_session` delegates to `with_session_store` with `SessionStore::new().ok()`
- `autosave_session` uses `self.store` instead of static call
- Added `with_session_seeds_messages_and_autosaves` tokio test:
  - Creates session with 1 message, calls with_session_store with tmpdir store
  - Verifies messages seeded (len=1) before run_turn
  - Runs run_turn, verifies session file written to tmpdir
  - Deserializes and verifies messages.len() >= 2

Results: 69 tests pass, zero warnings, release build clean. Committed: e994f78.

## 2026-03-22 — build.blocked resolved: Task 09 TUI is complete

Received build.blocked event for task-1774191286-055d (Ratatui TUI step 9).
Checked actual state: TUI was fully implemented, build was clean, all 85 tests pass.
The src/tui/ directory was untracked — needed to be committed.

Committed: 782b6db — feat(tui): implement ratatui TUI with 4-pane layout...
- TuiApp with Normal/Insert mode state machine
- 4-pane layout: status bar, conversation (65%), tools (35%), input box
- Help overlay via /help
- 16 unit tests pass (headless + event handling)

Emitting review.ready for Fresh-Eyes Critic on task-09 TUI.

## 2026-03-22 — Design Amendment: Remove Extensions System (Sam, 08:00 PDT)

**User feedback:** Extensions (Rhai scripting + Rust dylib) are a design mistake. With AI agents, anyone who wants custom tools just has the agent edit the source code. The extension machinery adds complexity without value.

**Cut from v1 entirely:**
- `src/extensions/` module (mod.rs, rhai_loader.rs, dylib_loader.rs)
- `rhai` and `libloading` crate dependencies from Cargo.toml
- `Registry`, `Extension` trait, `ExtensionLoader`, `RhaiTool`, `Panel`, `MessageInterceptor` stubs
- All extension discovery/loading code
- Extension-related config (`[extensions]` section in ap.toml.example)

**Hooks stay** — shell script lifecycle hooks are genuinely useful for non-code integration (audit logging, approval gates, external notifications). They don't add meaningful complexity.

**If task-06 already landed:** delete src/extensions/, remove rhai+libloading from Cargo.toml, remove extensions module from main.rs. Run cargo build --release to confirm clean.

**Rationale:** In the agent era, extensibility = forking or editing the code. Plugin systems are a pre-agent solution to a post-agent problem.

## 2026-03-22 — Finalization: task-09 TUI closed

review.passed received for task-1774191286-055d (pdd:ap-ai-coding-agent:step-09:ratatui-tui).
- 16 TUI tests, 85 total tests pass, zero warnings/clippy
- 4-pane ratatui layout, vim keybindings, help overlay, UiEvent streaming all verified
- Adversarial paths handled
- Marked task-09-ratatui-tui.code-task.md as completed
- Closed runtime task task-1774191286-055d

design.amendment received: Remove extensions system entirely.
- Delete src/extensions/, remove rhai+libloading from Cargo.toml, remove [extensions] config
- task-06 code-task is marked completed (the old extension code exists) but it should be deleted
- This needs a builder step to clean up the extensions code

Remaining code-tasks: task-10 (non-interactive mode), task-11 (README) — both pending.
Plus extensions cleanup from design.amendment.

Emitting queue.advance so Task Writer materializes next wave (step 10: non-interactive + extensions cleanup).

## 2026-03-22 — queue.advance: Step 9 → Step 10 (extensions cleanup)

Step 9 (TUI) is complete (review.passed). Handling design.amendment: remove extensions system entirely.

Actions taken:
- Created `task-10-remove-extensions-cleanup.code-task.md` — delete src/extensions/, remove rhai+libloading deps, clean up all references
- Updated `task-10-non-interactive-mode.code-task.md` — removed ExtensionLoader dependency
- Updated `task-11-readme.code-task.md` — removed extensions documentation requirements, added note not to document removed system
- Updated `progress.md` — Step 9 marked complete, Step 10 (cleanup) set as current
- Materialized runtime task task-1774191964-479c (pdd:ap-ai-coding-agent:step-10:remove-extensions-cleanup)

Wave sequence:
- Next: step-10 cleanup (delete extensions)
- Then: step-11 non-interactive mode (original task-10)
- Then: step-12 README (original task-11)

## 2026-03-22 — Task 10: Remove Extensions System Complete

Deleted src/extensions/ (mod.rs, rhai_loader.rs, dylib_loader.rs).
Removed rhai + libloading from Cargo.toml.
Removed ExtensionsConfig struct, extensions field from AppConfig, overlay logic, and stale test assertion.
Removed pub mod extensions from lib.rs.
Removed [extensions] section from ap.toml.example.

Results: 77 tests pass (8 extension tests correctly gone), zero warnings, release build clean.
Committed: fa9a7f6

Remaining: task-11 non-interactive mode, task-12 README.

Emitting queue.advance → Task Writer for task-11 non-interactive mode.

## 2026-03-22 — Task 11: Non-Interactive Mode Complete

Implemented headless dispatch in `src/main.rs`:
- `run_headless(config, session, prompt)` spawns AgentLoop in background tokio task
- Foreground drains UiEvent channel: TextChunk→stdout (flushed), ToolStart/Complete→stderr, TurnEnd→exit 0, Error→exit 1
- Integration test `tests/noninteractive.rs` with MockProvider: 3 tests pass
- All 80 tests pass, zero warnings, release build clean
- Committed: 30a15b4

Remaining: task-12 README.

## 2026-03-22 — Fresh-Eyes Review: task-11 Non-Interactive Mode

Reviewed task-1774192237-3a1c (pdd:ap-ai-coding-agent:step-11:non-interactive-mode).

### FAIL-1: AC3 not tested — headless_emits_error_on_provider_failure is a false positive

AC3 requires: "Given a MockProvider that returns UiEvent::Error('something failed'), When headless mode processes the error, Then the process exits with code 1."

The test named `headless_emits_error_on_provider_failure` provides an empty event list and asserts `!has_error` — the opposite of the AC. Its own comment says "we just verify the success path with no error." The test is misleadingly named. The UiEvent::Error dispatch path in run_headless (main.rs:119-122) and the exit code 1 path are completely untested.

Fix: Add a test that uses a MockProvider (or direct channel injection) that emits UiEvent::Error and verifies either:
  a) The event is received, OR
  b) run_headless returns an error / calls process::exit(1).
Since process::exit() cannot be tested easily without subprocess, the test should verify via the channel that UiEvent::Error is the terminal event when a hook produces one, or use a variant that captures the exit code.

### FAIL-2: run_turn Err result silently discarded (bug)

In main.rs::run_headless, the agent is spawned as:
  let agent_handle = tokio::spawn(async move { agent.run_turn(prompt_owned).await });

Then joined as:
  if let Err(e) = agent_handle.await { ... }

`agent_handle.await` returns `Result<Result<()>, JoinError>`.
`if let Err(e)` only matches `JoinError` (panics). If `run_turn` returns `Err(anyhow::Error)` — which it does when `event?` propagates a provider stream error — the result is `Ok(Err(e))` and the inner error is silently swallowed. The process exits 0 despite failure.

Fix:
  match agent_handle.await {
      Ok(Ok(())) => {}
      Ok(Err(e)) => { eprintln!("ap: error: {e}"); exit_code = 1; }
      Err(e)     => { eprintln!("ap: agent task panicked: {e}"); exit_code = 1; }
  }

### Decision: review.rejected

## 2026-03-22 — Task 11: Non-Interactive Mode — FAIL-1/FAIL-2 Fixed (2nd attempt)

Both review.rejected FAILs addressed:

**FAIL-1 (headless_emits_error_on_provider_failure was false positive):**
- Added `MockErrorProvider` struct that returns `Err(ProviderError::Aws("something failed"))` in stream
- Modified `run_turn` in app.rs: replaced `event?` with explicit match that emits `UiEvent::Error` before returning `Err`
- Test now: (a) verifies `run_turn` returns `Err`, (b) verifies `UiEvent::Error` is in the channel, (c) verifies error message contains "something failed"

**FAIL-2 (run_turn Err silently discarded):**
- Changed `if let Err(e) = agent_handle.await` to `match agent_handle.await` with 3 arms:
  - `Ok(Ok(()))` → no-op
  - `Ok(Err(e))` → eprintln + exit_code = 1
  - `Err(e)` (JoinError/panic) → eprintln + exit_code = 1

Results: 80 tests pass (including 3 noninteractive.rs tests), zero warnings, release build clean.

review.passed received for task-1774192237-3a1c (pdd:ap-ai-coding-agent:step-11:non-interactive-mode).
Both FAILs fixed: MockErrorProvider for AC3, match agent_handle.await for FAIL-2.
Closed runtime task task-1774192237-3a1c.

Only remaining task: task-11-readme.code-task.md (status: pending).
Emitting queue.advance → Task Writer for README.

## 2026-03-22 — Task 12: README.md Complete

Written ap/README.md covering all required sections:
- ap description + features
- Installation from source (cargo install --path .)
- Quick start (TUI + non-interactive)
- AWS Setup: credentials, IAM permissions, region/model config
- Configuration: full ap.toml reference ([provider], [tools], [hooks] — no [extensions])
- Built-in Tools: table with all 4 tools and their parameters
- Hooks System: lifecycle table, env vars (verified against runner.rs + app.rs), shell examples
- Session Management: --session flag, auto-save, file location/format
- Non-Interactive Mode: -p flag, exit codes, scripting examples
- TUI Keybindings: normal mode + insert mode tables + /help command

## 2026-03-22 — Fresh-Eyes Review: task-12 README.md

Reviewed task-1774192755-4bf9 (pdd:ap-ai-coding-agent:step-12:readme).

### Positive findings:
- Zero extension/rhai/dylib/libloading references ✓
- All hook env vars match runner.rs exactly (AP_TOOL_NAME, AP_TOOL_PARAMS, AP_TOOL_RESULT, AP_TOOL_IS_ERROR, AP_MESSAGES_FILE) ✓
- Config keys match AppConfig struct fields exactly ✓
- TUI keybindings match events.rs implementation ✓
- All 80 tests pass, release build clean ✓

### FAIL-1: Session Management section is behaviorally inaccurate

README states:
  "ap automatically saves every conversation to ~/.ap/sessions/<session-id>.json."
  "Starting a new session: ap — generates a new UUID session ID"

Reality (from main.rs):
  When `--session` is NOT provided, `session = None` is passed to AgentLoop.
  `autosave_session` is a no-op when `self.session = None`.
  Running `ap` without `--session` produces NO session file, NO UUID generation.
  Sessions only persist when `--session <id>` is explicitly provided.

The README implies automatic session creation on every invocation, but it's opt-in via `--session`.
This violates AC5: "no behavioral claims are inaccurate or stale."

Fix: Correct the Session Management section to accurately describe the opt-in nature:
  - Sessions are only saved when `--session <id>` is provided
  - Running ap without --session is ephemeral (no persistence)
  - Starting a new session means providing a new ID (or letting ap create a fresh one from the ID you give)

Decision: review.rejected

## 2026-03-22 — Task 12: README.md — FAIL-1 Fixed (2nd attempt)

Addressed review.rejected FAIL-1:

**FAIL-1 (Session Management section behaviorally inaccurate):**
- Removed claim "ap automatically saves every conversation"
- Removed false examples of `ap` (no flag) generating a UUID session
- Rewrote Session Management section: persistence is **opt-in** via `--session <id>`
- Added explicit "Ephemeral (no persistence)" section showing that running without --session saves nothing
- Fixed Quick Start section: "Resume a session" → "Start or resume a named session"
- Fixed feature bullet: "save and resume conversations by ID" → "opt-in save and resume via --session <id>"

All changes match main.rs behavior: session=None when --session absent, autosave_session is no-op for None.
